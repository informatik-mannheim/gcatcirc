\description{
This function factors a igraph (\url{http://igraph.org/r/}) object of an representing graph of a circular code.
The following definition describes a directed graph to an code.
Recall from graph theory (Clark and Holton, 1991) that a graph G consists of
a finite set of vertices (nodes) V and a finite set of edges E. Here, an edge is a set \{v,w\} of vertices
from V . The graph is called oriented if the edges have an orientation, i.e. edges are considered to be
ordered pairs \link{v,w} in this case.\cr
Definition Let X be a code and i be a positive integer, the component index.
We define a directed graph G(X) =
(V (X),E(X)) with set of vertices V (X) and set of edges E(X) as follows:
V (X) = \{N1...Ni,Ni+1...Nn : N1N2N3...Nn in X\} for a given i \cr
E(X) = \{\link{N1...Ni,Ni+1...Nn} : N1N2N3...Nn in X\} for a given i\cr
The graph G(X) is called the i-component of the representing graph of X or the graph associated to X.\cr
